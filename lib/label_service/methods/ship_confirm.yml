# LabelService::Base's to_xml method will uses this file
# the keys will be camelized:

# Values are expected to be 
# instance methods (@sender_zip_code)
# class.config methods (class.config.api_version)
# in that order. They can also be string literals, in order to 
# set default values
# Note: string literals need to be escaped twice, i.e. "'NIL'"
